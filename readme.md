# Personalized Menu Recommender

# Project Background

We want to figure out a way to transition from the traditional drive-thru experience. Our solution to the problem is to improve the customerâ€™s experience while ordering at a restaurant drive-thru (which contributes to 70%~80% of the total income) by creating a personalized menu for customers based on their preferences. The goal/purpose of the project is to save the customers time and provide them with a personalized menu that takes into account their preferences, POS user data over time, dietary restrictions, and environmental factors. This would lead to an increase in user satisfaction, an increase in customer loyalty, and an increase in sales for our clients/partners.

With the support of Delphi Display Systems we created a solution that consists of a Mobile Application, Backend consiting of REST API endpoints and a python script that deals with the recommendations and updating user preferences
